methodology. With Kanban, I have had experience with past employers in how they adapt certain parts of the Kanban general practices, but never address the Service delivery or Change Management principles so the process just stalls at the Kanban Board. It seems this process is easier to separate, and you can use the part without the whole. In addition, in the world of continuous quality improvement, I believe that sometimes we need to blow up the entire process and start fresh whereas Kanban principles advocate to start with the current process.  Again, I would choose ASD, but I would incorporate some elements of the Kanban board to facilitate visualization especially for the collaboration with clients and the review during the Learn phase.
We do not have to limit project management to something that happens in the work environment or on the software team. Skills can and should be developed to achieve consistency regardless of the career field or job position. Since project management is used by so many different entities it makes sense that it cannot be limited to a one-size-fits-all approach. Rather, project management is a very dynamic tool that can be adjusted based on project specific conditions. In addition, when project management principles are applied to teams, it may be necessary to modify methodologies to a framework that best fits the team makeup and goal. So at times we may need to consider methodologies that work best for the team, instead of only those we prefer.
